<strong>Create </strong>a 1-page physical network diagram using Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Visio<sup>®</sup> based on the same design as the logical one you created in Week Two. Pay particular attention to the security of the network.

<strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>paste</strong> this diagram into a Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Word document. Do not submit Microsoft<sup>®</sup>Visio<sup>®</sup> files.

In the same Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Word document, <strong>write</strong> a 175-word summary of the team discussions, including a narrative of your chosen network security. While you will discuss this as a team, each diagram should be individualized.
